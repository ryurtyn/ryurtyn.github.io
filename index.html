        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
          Hey, I'm Ruslana! I've recently completed my Masters of Engineering in Computer Science at Cornell Tech. Prior to that, I graduated 
          from UC Berkeley in 2023 with a Bachelor's in Computer Science and a minor in Data Science (Berkeley AND Cornell? I'm really 
          collecting the bear mascots).
        </p>
        <p>
          At Cornell Tech, I had an incredible experience working on various advanced tech projects. I was the runner-up for the Startup Award
          with my startup, MercuryVote. I also delved into NLP research with Sasha Rush, focusing on using LLMs to extract information from 
          large legal documents. Additionally, I explored computer vision and AI to extract procedural information from egocentric task-based
           videos at the XR Collaboratory. My coursework included a strong focus on Machine Learning, Computer Graphics, and Computer Vision. My 
           favorite class was Intelligent Autonomous Systems -- a class that touched on perception, control, planning, and learning in robotics. 
        </p>
        <p>
          During my time at UC Berkeley, I had the privilege of being a TA for the <a href="https://cs61a.org/">largest undergraduate course</a>  
          (1,500+ students!). I also served as the President of <a href="https://awe.berkeley.edu/">the Association of Women in EE&CS</a> and 
          championed diversity and inclusion as the DE&I Chair for <a href="https://csmentors.berkeley.edu/#/">Computer Science Mentors</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now, I'm a Software Engineer at Amazon and I'm currently living in Seattle. Let me know if you have any Seattle recommendations for good food or fun events. 
        </p>
        <!-- <p>
        Beyond my academic pursuits, I've had some awesome internships at Amazon and the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency, where I worked 
        on projects involving automation tools and machine learning.
        </p> -->
        <!-- <p>
        Now, I'm getting ready to start a full-time position where I can continue to learn and apply my skills. When I'm not working on tech projects, 
        you can find me sitting in a park reading a good fantasy novel, exploring the best food in NYC, and crafting 
        (I like to knit and crochet).
